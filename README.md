# IL_COVID_19_EC_Project
This was an extra credit assignment exploring government data on COVID-19 using Tableau. I was able to complete this assignment while I was at university. 

The PDF is an exported presentation of select slides of the Tableau workbook. 
The tableau file is included in this repository which contains an interactive dashboard / story detailing information about COVID-19 related information.
